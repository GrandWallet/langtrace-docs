## Overview

Django is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. Langtrace can be easily integrated with Django applications with the help of the Langtrace SDK.

## Steps

Follow the steps below to integrate Langtrace with your Django application:

- Install the Langtrace SDK. Initialize django project and add this inside the **init.py** file

```python Python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
from openai import OpenAI


langtrace.init(api_key="<LANGTRACE_API_KEY>")
client = OpenAI()

client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test three times"}],
    stream=False,
)
```
