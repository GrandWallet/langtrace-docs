### Self-hosting Langtrace

To run the Langtrace locally, you have to run three services:

- Next.js app
- Postgres database
- Clickhouse database

#### Requirements:

1. Docker is installed and running on your system. You can verify this by running:
   `docker info`
2. Docker Compose
   Docker Compose is installed on your system. You can verify this by running:
   `docker-compose --version`

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

Fetch the docker-compose.yml file
You can find the docker-compose.yml file and related files in the langtrace repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace)

#### Step 2: Configure environment variables

Modify the `.env` file to suit your needs.

#### Step 3: Starting the servers

```bash Bash
docker compose up
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

<Note>
  if you wish to build the docker image locally and use it, run the `docker
  compose up` command with the `--build` flag.
</Note>

To manually pull the docker image from docker hub, run the following command:

```bash Bash
docker pull scale3labs/langtrace-client:latest
```

#### Take down the setup

To delete containers and volumes

```bash Bash
docker compose down -v
```

`-v` flag is used to delete volumes

#### Useful Ops Commands

The following are some commands that may come handy during setup and debugging.

- Connecting to postgres db

```bash Bash
docker exec -it langtrace-postgres psql --dbname=langtrace --username=ltuser --password
```

- Connecting to clickhouse server

```bash Bash
docker exec -it langtrace-clickhouse clickhouse-client
```

- Checking langtrace client app logs

```bash Bash
docker logs langtrace
#If you want to follow the logs `bash docker
docker  logs -f langtrace
```

- Running prisma schema apply command

```bash Bash
docker exec -it langtrace npm run create-tables
```

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Table not found error OR Column not found error">
  Its likely that schema is not applied to the database or the schema is not in
  sync with the database. To fix this, run the following command: `bash docker
  exec -it langtrace npm run create-tables `
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Prisma schema not in sync with database">
  If you have made changes to the prisma schema and want to apply the changes to
  the database, run the following command: `bash docker exec -it langtrace npm
  run create-tables `
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Docker compose failing to setup with `Additional property required is not allowed` errors">
  Its likely that you are using an older version of docker-compose. Update
  docker-compose to the latest version. Certain docker compose schema used in
  this project are only supported in newer versions of docker-compose. Either
  you update the docker compose version OR remove the `depends_on property` that
  is causing the error.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clickhouse server not starting">
  If clickhouse server is not starting, it is likely that the port 8123 is already
  in use. You can change the port in the docker-compose file.
  </Accordion>

### Step 4: Sending traces to self-hosted Langtrace

Install the langtrace SDK in your application by following the same instructions under the Langtrace Cloud section above for sending traces to your self hosted setup.

### SDK Repositories
