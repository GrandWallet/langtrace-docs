## Self-hosting Langtrace

To run the Langtrace locally, you have to run three services:

- Next.js app
- Postgres database
- Clickhouse database

### Requirements

#### For Docker and Docker Compose

1. Docker is installed and running on your system. You can verify this by running:

	 `docker info`
2. Docker Compose is installed on your system. You can verify this by running:

	 `docker-compose --version`

#### For Standalone

1. Clickhouse DB self hosted or managed service
2. Postgres self hosted or managed service
