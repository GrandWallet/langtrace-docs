### Langtrace Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

To use the managed SaaS version of Langtrace, follow the steps below:

1. Sign up by going to [this link](https://langtrace.ai).
2. Create a new Project after signing up. Projects are containers for storing traces and metrics generated by your application. If you have only one application, creating 1 project will do.
3. Generate an API key by going inside the project.
4. In your application, install the Langtrace SDK and initialize it with the API key you generated in the step 3.
5. The code for installing and setting up the SDK is shown below:

If your application is built using Typescript/Javascript/Python:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Typescript
  npm i @langtrase/typescript-sdk

import \* as Langtrace from '@langtrase/typescript-sdk // Must precede any llm module imports
Langtrace.init({ api_key: <your_api_key> })

````

```typescript Python
import * as Langtrace from '@langtrase/typescript-sdk // Must precede any llm module imports

LangTrace.init() // LANGTRACE_API_KEY as an ENVIRONMENT variable
````

</CodeGroup>

You can now start shipping traces to Langtrace Cloud. üöÄ
