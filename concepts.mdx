Exploring some of the key concepts to understand when using Langtrace AI for your traces.

The traces generated by Langtrace adhere to Open Telemetry Standards(OTEL). We are developing semantic conventions for the traces generated by this project. You can checkout the current definitions in [this repository](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-trace-attributes/tree/main/schemas).

<Note>
  This is an ongoing development and we encourage you to get involved and
  welcome your feedback.
