DSPy is a framework for algorithmically optimizing LM prompts and weights, especially when LMs are used one or more times within a pipeline.

Langtrace has first class support for DSPy, allowing you to capture traces from your DSPy pipelines or agents automatically and analyze them in Langtrace.

## Setup

1. Follow the [DSPy installation guide](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy?tab=readme-ov-file#1-installation) to install DSPy.
2. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
3. Run your DSPy pipeline or agent and view the traces in Langtrace.
